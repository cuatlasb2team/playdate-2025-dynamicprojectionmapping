TWO OPTIONS:

1) Mask

Have to take web cam ‘vs’ projector alignment/lensing issue into account..
Better to just use an infrared cam
Basic masking in Resolume not intuitive
  anything that gets masked, all the pixels need to be black
  Auto mask effect on camera input, layer set to “50 Mask”
TD was a fail, don’t need it
  adds latency
  Also creating video feedback

Media pipe plugin w TD?
  Xyz coordinates, facial markings, etc

Next chapter:
  More projectors for 3d objects
  Kinect or ZED 
    And/orrr trackers!!?

2) OSC —> Sending coordinates to corners of quads
-blob track?

Didn’t get to try this approach..
